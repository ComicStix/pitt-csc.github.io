  bio: "I'm a Sophomore CS student and front-end developer working with a company called Mysterious Trousers. Ever since getting an internship with them in high school, I've wanted to build a way for students to pass on their knowledge to other students and to teach people about how much fun programming can be. Last year I started talking about starting the Pitt CSC, and now here we are, less than a year later! I'm so excited to be starting on this venture with such a great group of people and am eager to help out anyone in any way I can."

  bio: "I'm a junior CS major who is interested in web dev and security, and other stuff I haven't actually checked out yet. When I'm not programming I like playing video games (WoW especially) and going on adventures.
