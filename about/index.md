title: About Pitt CSC
---

We, the Computer Science Club at the University of Pittsburgh, are a community of young software developers, scientists, and designers dedicated to honing our craft. We meet regularly to share what we're learning, discuss developments in our field, and build things. [Talk to us](#contact).

## What we do

* Education: At our weekly meetings, we host talks that equip our members to become better programmers. We also host workshops every other week where we explore topics in greater depth.
* Projects: We encourage members to team up on side projects. We help by matching members with complementary skills and interests. When possible, we also provide financial support for project materials.
* Community Building: We host social events where members can get to know each other. At our weekly meetings, we set aside time for mingling and town hall discussions. With the help of our friends at [Code & Supply](http://www.codeandsupply.co/) and companies around Pittsburgh, we talk to professional developers about life after college.
