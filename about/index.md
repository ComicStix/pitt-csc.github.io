# About Pitt CSC

We, the Computer Science Club at the University of Pittsburgh, are a community of computer science and computer engineering students dedicated to honing our craft. We meet regularly to share what we're learning, discuss developments in our field, and build things. [Talk to us](#contact).

## What we do

* Education: We host student-run workshops to introduce each other to new tools and best practices.
* Projects: We form teams and master new technologies.
* Networking: We like each other, so we hang out. We also like meeting technologists from around Pittsburgh.
