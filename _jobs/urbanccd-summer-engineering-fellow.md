Our very own Will Engler is looking for people to join him for the summer to work on [Plenario](http://plenar.io/) at the University of Chicago!  This is a great opportunity for students looking for a summer internship or people that have a free summer before starting something full-time in the Fall.

> [The Urban Center for Computation and Data](http://www.urbanccd.org/#urbanccd) is a research group within The University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory. We build tools that help urban scientists, policy makers, and citizens better understand their cities. The summer fellowship would focus on [Plenario](http://plenar.io/) and [Array of Things](https://arrayofthings.github.io/). With Array of Things, we're deploying 500 custom-built sensor nodes around the city of Chicago to collect unprecedented data about the micro-environments of a major city. Plenario is our platform for making it easier to discover and prepare open geospatial data.
>
> The fellowship would likely focus on integrating Array of Things sensor data into Plenario to make sure the data is as accessible as possible. But depending on the fellow's interest and expertise, we might decide to focus on another area of development.
>
> Our stack includes:
>
> - Backend: Python, Postgres
> - Frontend: Ember, Leaflet
> - Ops: AWS

> - Competitive stipend
> - Help getting a summer place in Chicago
> - Everything we create is open source. ([Sensor network code](https://github.com/waggle-sensor), [Plenario code](https://github.com/UrbanCCD-UChicago/plenario))
> - Start/end dates are flexible
> - Both continuing students and recent grads who have a free summer are welcome
