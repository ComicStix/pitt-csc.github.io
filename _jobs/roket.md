You’ll be developing an iOS or Android app that communicates over Bluetooth with a new consumer product not yet released. You’ll most likely work on-site at the company’s headquarters 5 days a week for 3-4 months. In that timeframe, you and the team you’re working with will be ready to release to the App Store and Google Play. This is one of America’s fastest growing companies and is filled with incredible talent. Nothing is promised, but after the contract is up, full time opportunities may be an option.
