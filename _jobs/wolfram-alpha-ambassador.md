Wolfram Alpha reached out to us to let us know about their student ambassador program.  Check out the email they sent below:

> Good Afternoon!

> Here at Wolfram Research, we've recently developed a program open

> In addition to making a lasting impression as a professional in the
> technology world, student ambassadors get free access to online training
> and select Wolfram technologies, opportunities to be a guest blog
> contributor, admission to the annual Wolfram Technology Conference, and
> more!
