The Pitt Computer Science Club has been active for about two months now. With the semester half-way through, now seems like a good time to reflect on how we're doing as a club.

What We've Done Well
-----------------------

* **Community**: I think that the most valuable thing this club provides is an opportunity for members to meet each other. I’ve met so many interesting people and made good friends from this club. I hope others have had a similar experience.

* **Meetings and Workshops**: Every week, I look forward to the meetings. We bring in interesting talks, but I most enjoy the parts where we open it up to everyone. I’d like to see more presentations from members, but overall I think the meetings are a success.

* **Branching Out**: If it weren’t for the CSC, I wouldn’t have had the chance to check out some cool meetups or meet some local developers. By bringing in more local developers and letting everyone know about tech events, we can help connect Pitt to Pittsburgh's tech scene.

What We Can Improve On
-------------------------

* **Projects**: Enabling our members to learn by doing was a big priority for us. I'm proud of what we've done on our projects so far, but we can do a much better job of organizing them. The Projects Committee is taking what we've learned this semester and designing a new system. I'm excited to see how our next batch of projects will turn out.

* **Focus**: We're ambitious. We want to put on helpful workshops, run entertaining meetings, organize killer projects, and host big events like hackathons. This ambition is laudable, but I fear that we might overextend ourselves. I for one have overcommitted myself this semester. I haven't been putting enough time into my role as project leader for the beginner security project. In the second half of the semester, I plan on cutting back on some of my commitments to focus on the club’s core mission.

* **Growth**: We could be reaching a ton more students across CS, CoE, IS and more. There are lots of students in these majors who haven't heard of us but would probably like to join. With the officers focused on the day-to-day, we haven't put in the time to bring in new members. We plan to fix this by making a new officer position focused solely on growing the club.

Disclaimer
---------------

This is just my perspective. I can’t speak for all the officers or the club at large. Please contact an officer to let us know how you think the club is doing and how we can improve. Or better yet, come talk to an officer before or after a Monday meeting or find us during the week in Sennott Square.
